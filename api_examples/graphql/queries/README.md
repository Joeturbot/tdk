# GraphQL Queries
Turbot relies heavily on GraphQl for all data and resource management tasks. The Turbot console and Turbot Terraform providers are both front-ends for the Turbot GraphQL API.  To assist administrators and developers with integrating Turbot into the broader enterprise eco-system, this folder provides examples of common tasks.

Tasks are broken down by service platform, namely `aws`, `azure`, `gcp` and `turbot`.
